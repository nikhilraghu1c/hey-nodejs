# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

- Vite is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. It consists of two major parts:

    1. A dev server that provides rich feature enhancements over native ES modules, for example extremely fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR).

    2. A build command that bundles your code with Rollup, pre-configured to output highly optimized static assets for production.
